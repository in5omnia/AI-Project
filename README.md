## Artificial Intelligence Project
with [@powy-e](https://www.github.com/powy-e)

The objective of this project is the development of a program in Python 3.8 that, given an instance of the Bimaru problem (also known as the Battleship Puzzle), returns a solution, i.e., a fully filled grid. 
The program reads an instance of Bimaru from the standard input, solves the problem and print the solution to the standard output.
